# ðŸ¤– PuroSelosWalangLabel.java

> _"Di mo mahuli, pero ramdam mo."_

PuroSelosWalangLabel.java is a Robocode robot created for a university project, designed with a mix of evasive movement and aggressive finishing tactics. Inspired by hugot culture, the botâ€™s name reflects its behavior: elusive yet impactful.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Bot

- **Strategy**: A hybrid of dodging and ramming.

  - **Movement**: Uses a modified Stop-and-Go strategy (`umiwasSaCommitmentMovement`) to dodge incoming fire dynamically.
  - **Targeting**: Circular targeting with predictive aiming and adaptive bullet power.
  - **Kill Secure**: When the enemy's energy is low, the bot attempts a ramming finisher using the `ramNaKungRamSystem`.

- **Customization**: Includes a separate color manager to stylize the robot.

- **Design Principles**:
  - Modular components for radar, targeting, movement, and ramming.
  - Clean and commented code for better readability and maintenance.
